Input: "Dish: Gallo Pinto -variation 4"
Output: "Ingredients:
- 1 lb (450 gr.) Black beans. Fresh are best but most likely you’ll find them dried.
- 8-10 sprigs cilantro (coriander leaf) fresh or frozen, not dried!
- 1 small or medium onion
- 1/2 small red or yellow sweet pepper (optional)
- 3 cups (700 ml) chicken broth or water
- 2 cups (350 ml) white rice
- 3/2 teaspoon (2.5 ml) salt
- 1 Tablespoon (15 ml) vegetable oil
- 1-3 Tablespoon oil to fry the Gallo Pinto
Preparation:
If beans are dried, cover with water and soak overnight, if they are “fresh” (still dried, but only from laying out in the sun like they do in Costa Rica), just rise them off. Drain the beans and add fresh water to an inch (2.5-cm) above the top of the beans and bring to a boil. Cover the pan and reduce heat to very low simmer until beans are soft (~3 hours).  Add salt.
Chop cilantro, onion, and sweet pepper very fine.
Add 1 Tablespoon oil to a large pan and sauté the dry rice for 2 minutes over medium high flame then add half of the chopped onion, sweet pepper and cilantro and sauté another 2 minutes. Add water or chicken broth, bring to a boil, cover and reduce heat to simmer until rice is tender (20-35 minutes). This is also the recipe for Tico rice used in other favorites like tamales.
Once the rice and beans are cooked you can refrigerate or freeze them. Make up small batches of Gallo Pinto when you want it by simply sautéing them together. Keep a significant amount of the “black water” with the beans (½-1 cup 120-240 ml). This is what gives the rice its color and some of its flavor. Sauté the rice, beans reserved chopped onion, sweet pepper and cilantro together in vegetable oil for a few minutes. Sprinkle with a little fresh chopped cilantro just before serving."

Input: "Dish: Gallo Pinto -variation 5"
Output: "Ingredients:
- Vegetables: Red Bell Pepper, Onion, Celery, and Fresh Cilantro.
- Butter and Vegetable Oil
- Black Beans
- Cooked Rice: Leftover cold rice works best. If you don’t any, cook 1 cup dry rice (should make about 3 cups cooked), and once it’s cooked, pour it out onto a baking tray and refrigerate or freeze it until cool. Then proceed with recipe as instructed.
- Salsa Lizano: Purchase from Amazon, an International Foods Market, or try this homemade version.
- Seasonings: Garlic, Chicken Bouillon and Cumin.
Preparation:
Drain black beans, but reserve the bean broth from the can, and set aside.
Heat a skillet over medium high heat. Add oil. Once hot, add butter, bell pepper, onion and celery and sauté for 5 minutes. Add garlic and cook 1 minute.
Add salsa lizano, black beans, ¼ cup bean broth from the can, chicken bouillon and cumin. Simmer for 5-8 minutes, until most of liquid evaporates.
Add rice and gently fold in to combine. Cook on low for 10 minutes, tossing occasionally–don’t “stir” it. I use a spatula to scoop and flip it, allowing it to fry on all sides, on low heat. It should have a similar texture to fried rice (should not be mushy).
Taste and season with salt and pepper, if needed. Add cilantro and toss in to combine.
Serve with a warm tortilla on the side, fried or scrambled eggs, or fried plantains."

Input: "Dish: Gallo Pinto -variation 6"
Output: "Ingredients:
- Cooked Rice. Day-old rice cooked on the stovetop or in the Instant Pot is best as it does not have quite as much moisture as freshly cooked. Brown or white rice can be used, but white is the traditional ingredient. 
- Beans. While pinto beans are commonly chosen, black beans have become the new staple and are what are used in this recipe. Go for canned beans to keep it simple, just make sure to rinse and drain before cooking! You can also opt for red kidney beans if that’s what you have.
- Lizano Sauce. The star of the show when it comes to where this dish gets its flavor. You can leave this special sauce out, but it won’t have the same traditional taste. Don’t skip the bottle of salsa Lizano, it’s the secret ingredient. You should be able to find it at some local grocery stores, but Amazon is a sure bet.
- Onion. A sweet onion is best in this recipe, but a red or white onion can also be substituted.
- Red Bell Pepper. You can also use a green bell pepper, but the red does give the dish a subtle sweetness and a brilliant color.
- Spices. Cumin, paprika, and cayenne pepper help boost the flavor profile.
- Cilantro. This is optional but brings a bite of freshness.
Preparation:
Dice the onion and bell pepper into small pieces so every bite has some in there.
Sauté diced onion and bell pepper in a large skillet for 5-7 minutes then add crushed garlic and cook for 1 more minute. 
Add the leftover rice, drained beans, and seasoning ingredients to the skillet. Don’t forget to rinse and drain the beans first."

Output: "Ingredients:
- 1/4 cup (60ml) vegetable oil, divided
- 1 medium yellow onion, finely chopped (about 1 cup; 200g), divided
- 1 1/2 cups (10 ounces; 300g) long-grain white rice
- 3 cups (710ml) water or homemade or store-bought chicken stock
- 1 - 1/2 teaspoons (5g) Diamond Crystal kosher salt; for table salt, use half as much by volume or the same weight
- 1/2 green bell pepper (3 ounces; 85g), cored and seeded
Preparation:
For the Rice: In a large heavy-bottomed saucepan, heat 2 tablespoons oil over medium heat until shimmering. Add two-thirds of onion and cook, stirring, until softened and translucent, about 5 minutes. Add rice and cook, stirring, until grains are shiny and evenly coated with oil, 2 to 3 minutes. Add water or stock and salt, increase heat to high, and bring to a boil. Place bell pepper on top of rice.
Boil rice without stirring until most of the liquid has evaporated and you can see small bubbles bursting on the surface of the rice. Immediately reduce the heat to the lowest setting, cover, and cook for 15 minutes. Remove and discard bell pepper. Fluff rice with chopsticks or fork, then let cool. Transfer to an airtight container and refrigerate for 24 hours.
For the Beans: Spread beans out in a rimmed baking sheet. Pick out any debris and broken beans. Transfer beans to colander and rinse under cold running water. Place rinsed beans in a large pot and cover with cold water; water should cover beans about 3 inches. Let soak for 30 minutes.
Bring beans to a boil over high heat. Reduce heat to maintain a simmer and cook beans for 30 minutes. Turn off heat, cover beans, and let rest 1 hour. Bring beans back up to boil over high heat. Add salt and garlic, reduce heat to maintain a simmer, and cook until beans are tender, 30 to 60 minutes. Drain beans or, if desired, strain over a bowl and retain liquid for another use. You should have about 3 cups of cooked beans; measure out 2 cups of beans and reserve the rest for another use. 
For the Gallopinto: In large saucepan, heat remaining 2 tablespoons oil over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add remaining onion and cook, stirring, until softened and translucent, about 5 minutes.
Add rice and beans, and cook, stirring, until rice is evenly coated. Continue to cook, stirring, to allow flavors to meld and gallopinto to become slightly crisp, about 10 minutes. Serve immediately with scrambled or fried eggs, a side of corn tortillas, and queso fresco. If desired, cover and cook over low heat for an additional 10 minutes (see note)."

- 1 red bell pepper
- 1 yellow onion
- 3 large garlic cloves
- 1 bunch of scallions - The white and light green parts for the rice, the dark green tops reserved as a garnish
- Cilantro - both to flavor the rice and to sprinkle on as a topping
- Lizano Sauce - This popular Costa Rican condiment has been compared to Worcestershire Sauce. Savory and a little sweet, Lizano is an essential component of gallo pinto. Some cooks insist on adding a couple of tablespoons to the rice as it cooks. Others leave it out of the cooking process and suggest having a bottle on the table to use as a final topping. Either way, it will add a wonderful depth of flavor to the dish.
Preparation:
Start by sautéing the onions, peppers and garlic until they soften.
Next add the cooked rice and stir gently to combine.
Then add the beans and gently stir them into the rice mixture.
Lastly, stir in the scallions, chopped cilantro, salt, pepper and Lizano sauce, if using.

- 1 green bell pepper
- 1 red bell pepper (We skipped this.)
- 1 handful cilantro
- 4 tablespoons Salsa Lizano (Increase/reduce as per liking.)
- Salt to taste
Preparation:
Cook rice. This should preferably be done the night before. Supposedly refrigerated cooked rice works better for the mixing of rice and beans in this recipe.
Cook beans. This is where I made a customization to make the process faster. Original Gallo Pinto recipes call for slow cooking of beans. This usually takes 3-6 hours! I simply resorted to my good old pressure cooker to accelerate the beans cooking process from a few hours to less than 30 minutes. If you want to save even more time, you can also use store bought canned beans.
Beans – Dry, drain, broth
Drain the cooked beans but retain the broth in a separate bowl or cup. We will add this to the recipe later for flavor.
Chop fresh veggies
Dice the fresh veggies into small slices – onion, tomato, bell peppers, jalapeno. Chop the cilantro.
On the flame
Heat oil on a large pan. Add onion and saute for couple of minutes. Add garlic and jalapeno. Costa Rican cuisine does not usually feature a lot of jalapenos. But to satiate our Indian taste buds, I added that extra tint of hot through half a jalapeno. We did not have garlic clove at home, hence used garlic powder as replacement. Saute for another couple of minutes until the aroma is released.
Add tomato and bell peppers and cook for a few minutes. The original Gallo Pinto recipes do not include tomato. But I added this as we like it. Also, using tomato for home recipes is almost like a habit for me! Lower the flame.
On the flame + veggies + cooked beans
Add the cooked beans to the pan.
On the flame + veggies + cooked beans + cooked rice
Add the cooked rice to the pan. Pour some of the broth that was retained from the cooked beans. Add salt and Salsa Lizano. Mix well.
Finish cooking with flavors and garnishing
Add some more Salsa Lizano and chopped cilantro. Mix well. Salsa Lizano is the key ingredient in Costa Rican Gallo Pinto recipe. It is widely available on the supermarket shelves of Costa Rica. But if you cannot get hold of one in your region/country, you can replace it with Worcestershire sauce or else you can try to make Salsa Lizano at home!

Output: "Ingredients:
- Cooking supplies:
- Large stockpot (20 qt or larger)
- Plantain leaf or banana leaf, cut into 8" squares
- String or twine cut into 14-18" pieces
- Scissors
- Stirring spoon
- For the masa (dough):
- Pork broth (can substitute chicken broth)
- Maseca tamale mix (cornflour mix found in most grocery stores)
- Cold water
- 1 stick of margarine (can also use pork fat)
- 1 packet Maggi chicken bullion (consome de pollo)
- Salt (optional)
- For the filling:
- 2-3 pounds cooked pork shoulder (can substitute shredded chicken)
- carrots
- red pepper (sweet pepper)
- Costa Rican arroz arreglado (do not use dry rice) Recipe link above
Preparation:
The tamales are easiest when you make ahead the rice and pork. You can also make the rice while the tamale masa is cooking for the first round, but I prefer just to make the pork and rice the day before. 
Start with your very large stockpot. Add your entire packet of Maseca or similar tamal base to the pot. Next, add 2 cups of cold water and begin to mix this with your hands. The cold water will help so that the Maseca doesn't form little balls when you add the other ingredients. 
Add 2-4 cups of pork broth, chilled to room temperature, to the masa mixture. Stir until well mixed. (If you don't have pork broth, chicken or beef from a box will do).
Next add margarine, shortening, or pork fat and your packet of chicken bouillon (consome de pollo). Keep mixing everything until you have a base masa that is the consistency of watery cream of wheat.
Place ingredients on a hot stove and begin to heat, stirring occasionally to mix all the ingredients. Traditional Costa Rican cooking style calls to complete this step over an open fire or on a wood-burning stove, but I just do it on my regular old stove.
You will heat and stir until the mixture boils and the consistency is that of cream of wheat. If you like your tamales a bit saltier, you can taste this as you go and add up to an additional 2 tablespoons of salt. Some people add a bit of black pepper here but I never do.
While the mixture is cooking, someone usually sets up the plantain leaves and string to begin preparing for the next step: assembling the tamales.
In Costa Rica, plantain leaves are huge and a dime a dozen, but in the States, you may have to buy banana leaves instead. I recommend double wrapping the tamales either way. This means placing two plantain leaves on top of each other.
Once you have laid out all of the leaves, start by placing a good spoonful of masa in the middle of each leaf. I would say this is just over 1/2 cup of masa.
Next place a bit of rice in the middle of the masa. From here add a couple of carrot slices, a few red pepper slices, and some pork. Some people add peas, hard-boiled egg, raisins, garbanzo beans, mashed potatoes, onion, green sweet pepper, green beans, etc. Our family doesn't. 
Now you will fold the tamale. Pull up each of the long ends and roll them down as if you were folding a bag of chips or a paper lunch sack. Flatten this down on top of the tamale, then fold the short ends over. Place one tamal on top of the other and wrap them tightly with twine. 
When you wrap these, it's just like wrapping the ribbon around a Christmas present- except you do it twice- one time on each side.
Place all of the tamales back into a large pot (or just wash the one you were just using) and cover them with water. Cover and bring to a rolling boil. 
Boil the packets for 30 minutes. turn ff the heat and let cool in the boiling water for at least 30 more minutes. Remove, dry, and enjoy. In true Costa Rican style, you can slather with Salsa Lizano, and eat with coffee and good company."

Output: "Ingredients:
- 2 lbs instant corn masa mix
- 3 lbs (1.4 kg) pork shoulder roast -or- beef roast -or-
- boneless chicken
- ¼ lb (110 gr) pork lard (or vegetable shortening)
- 1 cup (240 ml) corn oil
- 1 batch (~5 cups cooked Tico style rice, see ingredient list and recipe below)
- 2 ¼ lbs (1 kg) potatoes
- 8 cloves of garlic
- ½ lb (225 gr) sweet or hot peppers to taste
- 1 large onion (optional)
- 2 ¼ lbs (1 kg) banana leaves (corn husks can be substituted, or if desperate aluminum foil)
- coriander leaves (cilantro), salt, black pepper, cumin, oregano, achiote (annato)
Preparation:
If you are adventurous and demand complete authenticity, you must start from raw corn ground for tamales (3 lbs, 1.4 kg Maíz cascado, malido crudo). Soak the flour in water then rinse it well, cook with a tablespoon of achiote, and a little of the garlic and peppers in salted water to just cover until tender then stand overnight. The next day, knead it into dough. You should probably have a demonstration first if you’re going to try this method. For first timers we’d suggest the Masa version described below.
Chop the meat into large (2″, 5 cm) chunks then brown on high heat in the ½ cup lard or vegetable oil. Add the chopped garlic, peppers, onion, 1 teaspoon salt, 1teaspoon cumin, ½ teaspoon black pepper, and 1 teaspoon salt for the last minute or two of browning, then cover with water and simmer until very tender (2-3 hours). Remove the meat from the broth and reserve the broth. When the meat is cool shred it finely. While the meat is simmering prepare the potatoes and rice.
Peel the potatoes and boil with salt, cilantro, and oregano to taste until soft. Cool and cut into ½ inch (1 cm) cubes."

Preparation:
Whenever you plan to cook the Tamales, place a large pot with enough water to cover the Tamales when inserted. After a batch are made, carefully insert them and boil slowly for 2 hours.
Chop the meat into ½” chucks, season and brown to near doneness. Season with garlic, peppers, onion, salt, and anything you fancy. Cook to a fair degree of doneness or it will reduce the time required for cooking theTamales. Separate the meat from the broth and set the broth aside to mix a little into the dough batter.
Combine the cooked rice and cubed potatoes, add seasoning like cumin, salt and black pepper to taste set aside in a bowl.
In a separate bowl mix the corn flour mixture, reserved liquids and a little sugar to create the pasty dough.
Place a square of clean banana leaf, glossy side down, and then place 3 generous table-spoons of corn dough in the center. Flatten to about ¼” thickness. Then place select chunks of meat, rice and potatoes, in the midst. Add a teaspoonful of cubed carrots, beets, green beans, chic peas, pineapple chunks or other. Then add a ½ teaspoon of celery, onions, tomatoes, green peas, raisins, green olives, sweet-peppers, cheese or whatever you like.
Close the dough to form a pocket. Bring up opposite sides of the leaf to close the sides by folding together; rolling the ends inwards to complete the leaf-package. Using cotton (or non synthetic) string to tie the four sides, closing the Tamale ensuring that it is leak-proof when submerged."

Preparation:
Clean plantain leaves
Butcher’s twine
In a heavy pot, in oil, fry chicken until golden brown. Then add 20 cups of water, which you will bring to a boil. Once boiling, add vegetables, garlic, Worchester sauce, salt and pepper. Cook on low heat, until chicken is tender. This should yield about 16 cups of stock, but you can add more water if necessary. Shred chicken by hand and reserve stock.
Mix ground corn masa and mashed potatoes together. In food processor, blend pork rind and pork lard with stock and add to masa. Process for a few minutes, until smooth—the consistency should be like a soft porridge. Add complete seasoning.
Cut plantain leaves into 12 inch rectangles. Align the two leaves—one horizontal, the other vertical. In the center of the leaves place a cup of corn masa, a piece of cooked chicken, a tablespoon of rice, 2 olives, 4 chickpeas, 1 tablespoon of corn, capers, raisins, one prune, a little petit pois, green beans, carrots, mashed beans and a slit of roasted pepper. For a vegetarian option, tamales can instead be filled with mashed potatoes, beans and vegetables.
To close the tamal, roll from the center and fold the edges towards the inside. Proceed likewise with the second plantain leaf and securely tie together with butcher’s twine. Line the bottom of a large pot with extra plantain leaves. Fill the pot halfway with water, bring to a boil and add salt. Place tamales in water and cook for 45-60 minutes. Serve warm.
Traditionally, Costa Rican tamales are cooked over a firewood fire to enhance their flavors. Try this method and enjoy your tamal with a cup of coffee for a complete Tico experience."

Add vegetable oil and broth. Mix with hands to make a paste. Spread 3-4 tablespoons of masa paste in center of two overlapping banana leaf squares center top with rice, potatoes, meat, and any extra, desired ingredients.
Carefully wrap the masa around your fillings, and then wrap banana leaves around the whole. Tie the bundle with kitchen string to keep closed. A “piña is one tamale and typically two are tied together with the string.
Steam your tamales for 30 minutes over boiling water and serve.
Tamales should be served with Christmas dinner, but can be frozen for up to 3 months; simply defrost and cook as with fresh, or cooked from frozen, if desired. You can steam them, boil them, or microwave them (though, I don’t recommend microwaving). Serve with a little bit of salsa lizano and a fresh cup of coffee.

Preparation
For the dough, sauté with the oil, the well-chopped garlic and the marjoram. Then add the other ingredients of the dough and mix.
For the filling, chop the carrot in thin slices and the red chili in small stripes. Divide the celery, the green peas and the rice into different bowls.
Clean the leaves and cut them the same size.
Once that the dough is cold make it into balls of the same size (from 100 to 125 g each one)
Now with all the ingredients ready, start to give a shape to the tamales. Take two leaves and put one of the dough balls over each. Smash it a little to put the rice over and then all the vegetables and the chicken. Finally, put a little branch of celery as decoration.
Close it carefully and make "piñas", so they won't open while cooking. They can also be frozen for 3 months, so any time you want to eat them, you just defrost and cook them. In this way, you will always eat fresh tamales.
Cook them for approximately 30 minutes."

Output: "Ingredients:
- 2 pounds beef shoulder roast
- Salt and pepper, to taste
- 2 onions, peeled and sliced
- 1 garlic bulb, cloves removed and peeled
- 4 ounces dried New Mexico chilies
- 2 ounces ancho chiles
- 2 ounces pasilla chiles
- 2 tablespoons cumin seed, toasted
- 1 tablespoons salt
- 2 bags dried corn husks, about 3 dozen
- 4 cups masa mix for tamales
- 1 tablespoon baking powder
- 2 teaspoons salt
- 4 cups reserved beef broth, warm
- 1 cup vegetable shortening
Preparation:
Beef; Season the beef shoulder all over with salt and pepper then brown in a large heavy pot over medium heat. Once browned on all sides, add enough water to cover the roast along with the 1 sliced onion and about 6 cloves of garlic.
Cook until the meat is fork tender and comes apart with no resistance, about 2 hours. When done, remove the roast to a platter to cool, reserve the beef broth. Hand shred the meat and set aside.
Sauce; To prepare the sauce, remove the tops of the dried chilies and shake out most of the seeds. Place the chilies in a large stockpot and cover them with water. Add the cumin, remaining sliced onion and garlic. Boil for 20 minutes until the chiles are very soft. Transfer the chiles to a blender using tongs and add a ladle full of the chile water (it is best to do this in batches.) Puree the chiles until smooth. Pass the pureed chiles through a strainer to remove the remaining seeds and skins. Pour the chili sauce into a large bowl and add salt, stir to incorporate. Taste to check seasonings, add more if necessary. Add the shredded beef to the bowl of chili sauce, and mix thoroughly. Refrigerate until ready to use.
Husks; go through the husks and sort by size and remove any silks or debris. Soak the corn husks in your sink filled with warm water until soft, about 30 minutes. (You can also soak husks in large bowls of water if you are not doing a lot of tamales).
Masa; In a deep bowl, combine the masa, baking powder, and salt. Pour the broth into the masa a little at a time, working it in with your fingers. In a small bowl, beat the vegetable shortening until fluffy. Add it to the masa and beat until the dough has a spongy texture.
Drain Husks; Rinse, drain, and dry the corn husks. Set them out on a sheet pan covered by a damp towel along with the bowls of masa dough and beef in chili sauce.
Spread Masa; Start with the largest husks because they are easier to roll. Lay the husk flat on a plate or in your hand with the smooth side up and the narrow end facing you. Spread a thin, even layer of masa over the surface of the husk with a tablespoon dipped in water. The easiest method of spreading masa is with a masa spreader (see side panel for how this is used) Do not use too much, keep the masa thin.
Add about a tablespoon of the meat filling in the center of the masa. Fold the narrow end up to the center then fold both sides together to enclose the filling. The sticky masa will form a seal. Pinch the wide top closed.
Fold; the sides of the corn husk to center over the masa so that they overlap to make a long package. Fold the empty part of the husk under so that it rest against the side of the tamale with a seam.
Steam; Place the tamales in a steamer and cook tamales for 2 hours. Check every 20 minutes. Do not let the water boil away. The tamale is cooked when it separates easily from the corn husk.
Serve; Unfold the husk and spoon about a tablespoon of remaing beef filling on top"

Output: "Ingredients:
- Rice
- Carrots
- Green beans
- Chunks of meat, usually pork
- Corn Flour
- Butter
- Corn Starch
- Cilantro
- Red peppers
- Garlic, salt, pepper, bullion
- Banana leaves
Preparation:
First, cook the rice and meat. Our host had already cooked the rice with spices, carrots and green beans. The pork was cut into chunks, browned and then boiled for a few hours. The resulting broth is basically what gives the tamales their flavor, so you want to make sure that it is full of garlic, cilantro, salt and pepper.
The next step is to make the ‘masa’, the corn flour based dough. Start by finding the largest bowl you can, then dump in a 5lb bag of corn flour (each bag this size should apparently make about 70-75 tamales). Combine with your broth (you can use water too if you don’t have enough) until it resembles a thin gooey soup. I have no measurements for this. Whenever I asked ‘how much?’ or ‘how long?’ the response was always, ‘until it looks right’ or ‘until it’s done’. Which is exactly how I cook, but makes it difficult to write about! Forget using a spoon; get your hands in to mix it so that you can easily get rid of any lumps. Taste it, and add more salt or bullion if needed. Add butter, about ½ cup for each bag of flour. Apparently it is more traditional to use pork lard, but butter tastes better and is a little healthier.
This mixture gets cooked on the stove for about 30 minutes until it begins to thicken, stirring often to keep lumps from forming. You then add cornstarch mixed with water and keep stirring until it has the consistency of cake batter. We were doing this outside in a huge drum over a woodfire. There is no control over the temperature or anything, but I would guess you would keep it on a medium heat on your stove. Remove from heat.
While you are waiting for your masa to cool enough to be handled, you can prep your other ingredients. Cut sprigs of cilantro and slivers of red peppers, enough to add one of each to each tamale. Cut clean pieces of banana leaves, each about 15” square. You can buy these at the local market around the holidays in Costa Rica already prepped and ready to go, or you can do it yourself. At our friend’s home, they were slicing leaves off the banana trees with a machete, then passing them over the fire a few times to soften and disinfect them. We then cleaned them with damp clothes and cut them to the appropriate size. The banana leaves are an important part of the whole process. Not only is it traditional, the fire-touched leaves impart flavor to the food and are part of the distinctive taste. Plus, it’s fun.
OK, so now you are ready to assemble the tamales. Place two layers of the banana leaf on the table (doubled up for strength), add a pancake-sized puddle of masa in the center, add a heaping tablespoon of your rice/veggie mix, a chunk of meat, a sprig of cilantro and a piece of pepper. Gather the corners on a diagonal, and fold over, then continue to fold down until you hit the filling. Fold one end in, pushing the mixture towards the center as you do so, and follow with the other side, always moving the filling towards the middle. 
When you have two, tie them together with string so the bottoms (the part with all the ends of banana leaf) are together with the smooth sides facing out. They are always wrapped in a duo like this and it is called a piña (which literally means “pineapple” in Spanish. I have no clue why it is called this, and no-one can tell me!). Once you have all your piñas together, add them to a pot of boiling water and boil for 45 minutes. This causes the mixture to firm up and cook together. Remove them from heat and add to cool water to set.
Once these have cooled, they are ready to enjoy. Our hosts dislike anything too spicy, but we love ours with hot sauce. On Friday, we were at our friends’ place for about 5 hours, during which time we made over 280 tamales! We took about a dozen home with us, but most will be consumed by the huge amount of family expected at their home over the holidays."

- 3 cups (700 ml) chicken broth or water
- 2 cups (350 ml) white rice
- ½ teaspoon (2.5 ml) salt
- 1 tablespoon (15 ml) vegetable oil
Preparation:
If you are adventurous and demand complete authenticity, you must start from raw corn ground for tamales (3 lbs, 1.4 kg maíz cascado, malido crudo).
Soak the flour in water then rinse it well, cook with a tablespoon of achiote, and a little of the garlic and peppers in salted water to just cover until tender then stand overnight.
The next day, knead it into dough.
You should probably have a demonstration first if you're going to try this method.
For first timers we'd suggest the masa version described below.
Chop the meat into large (2", 5 cm) chunks then brown on high heat in the ½ cup lard or vegetable oil.
Add the chopped garlic, peppers, onion, 1 teaspoon salt, 1teaspoon cumin, ½ teaspoon black pepper, and 1 teaspoon salt for the last minute or two of browning, then cover with water and simmer until very tender (2-3 hours).
Remove the meat from the broth and reserve the broth.
When the meat is cool shred it finely.
While the meat is simmering prepare the potatoes and rice.
Peel the potatoes and boil with salt, cilantro, and oregano to taste until soft.
Cool and cut into ½ inch (1 cm) cubes.
Chop cilantro, onion, and sweet pepper very fine.
Add 1 tablespoon oil to a large pan and sauté the dry rice for 2 minutes over medium high flame then add the chopped onion, sweet pepper and cilantro and sauté another 2 minutes.
Add water or chicken broth, bring to a boil, cover and reduce heat to simmer until rice is tender (20-35 minutes).
Allow the meat broth to cool until it is just warm.
To the dry masa add 1 tablespoon salt, 1 teaspoon ground cumin, and 1 teaspoon ground achiote, and mix dry.
Then add the vegetable oil, mix with your hands while adding the warm broth.
It should take about 2½ cups to make a paste the consistency of mashed potatoes.
Mix and add slowly, and if you over shoot on the broth and get it too thin, add a little more masa.
Wash the banana leaves then cut them into ~15&nbsp;inch (38&nbsp;cm) squares. Spread 2 tablespoons of masa paste in the center, add 1 tablespoon each of potatoes, rice and meat. Fold and cook the tamales in gently boiling water for about one hour.
If you substitute corn husks, you will need to make slightly smaller tamales, pack the pot full and steam them rather than boiling them, because the husks won't hold together while floating around."

- 2 large red sweet chili peppers.
- 2 cups of vegetable oil (traditional recipe uses pork fat).
- 2 cans of carrots.
- 2 cups of Lizano sauce.
- 2 white onions.
- 2 pepper teaspoons.
- 2 cumin teaspoons.
- 3 teaspoons of annatto powder.
- 1 package of banana leaves to make tamales and 1 roll of thread for holding tamales. These two are easily found in the supermarket.
Preparation:
On the day before preparing the recipe, marinate the meat. Remove the grease from the pork and chicken. Marinate the meat with 1 cup of Lizano sauce, 1 teaspoon of pepper, 1 teaspoon of cumin and 1 teaspoon of annatto powder. Leave the meat in the fridge for one day.
On the next day, add the rice in a rice cooker, plus add one chopped onion in very small squares, add a chopped red chili in very small squares, 1 teaspoon of pepper, 1 teaspoon of cumin, 2 teaspoons of annatto powder, 2 wedges of garlic and 1/2 cup of oil.
In a large pot, add the meat (that was left marinating from the previous day), then add water to cover the meat. Add 1 cup of Lizano sauce, the rest of the pepper, cumin, annatto, 2 wedges of garlic and 1/2 cup of oil. Cook over high heat for 30 minutes. The meat must be very well-cooked.
Take out the meat and let it cool. Leave the meat stock in the pot. Then cut the meat into square pieces about 4x4 centimeters.
Use the remaining meat stock in the pot, but first, remove the two garlic wedges. Add the package of cornmeal and 1 cup of oil. Stir over high heat for 30- 45 minutes, until the dough is cooked. Add water if the sauce evaporates too quickly. The consistency of the dough should be similar to plasticine.
In a bowl, mix an onion cut into very small pieces, a sweet chili cut into small pieces, the green peas and the carrot. This is a vegetable mix.
Spread two banana leaves on the table. Clean the leaves with a paper napkin.
On the leaves, put a large spoonful of dough (the soup serving spoon works perfectly), on the dough add a tablespoon of rice, a piece of pork and another of chicken and a tablespoon of the vegetable mixture.
Close the leaves carefully. Cut about 60 centimeters from the tamales thread and roll up the leaves. It is like putting a ribbon around a gift. Make sure the tamal is tightly closed. Don't forget to tie a double knot at the end.
The recipe is for making 14 to 20 tamales. Join two tamales with more threads. To make pairs of tamales, more commonly known as “piña de tamal.”
Put the paired tamales in a very large pot of boiling water. Cook for one more hour.
Then let the tamales cool a bit before eating.
If you put them in the fridge, heat the tamal again in boiling water for 20 minutes.
The preparation is quite elaborate and requires a lot of work, but it is worth it."

- EXTRA HOT SAUCE FOR GARNISH *UNFORTUNATELY THEY DON’T SELL SALSA LIZANO WHERE I LIVESO I USED ONE OF MY MEXICAN-STYLE HOT SAUCE.
Preparation:
Combine the sea salt and pepper. Season the pork belly on both sides, add the soy sauce and rub in to season all over. Place the pork belly on a plate and refrigerate overnight uncovered.
Remove pork belly from refrigerator 30 minutes before cooking. Preheat oven to 500ºF. Place the pork skin side up on a wire rack, lined with a baking sheet. Bake for 10 minutes at 500 degrees, lower temperature to 325ºF and roast for another 90 minutes. Remove from oven and let cool before slicing.
When ready to prepare chicharron, slice the pork belly into bite-size pieces. Transfer to a heavy pot and heat to medium/low. This takes a little while because you want the pork to release the fat slowly and cook in its own fat. Stir now and then and cook until pork becomes crispy in most spots. Remove from pan and drain onto paper towels.
In a bowl, combine all of the ingredients for the pico de gallo. Season to taste, cover and set aside.
In a medium sauce pan, preheat 2 tablespoons of olive oil to medium heat. Add the onions, garlic and celery. Season lightly with salt and pepper and continue cooking for 5 to 7 minutes. Add all of the remaining ingredients for the beans. Bring to a boil, reduce to simmer. Cover and cook for 20 minutes, taste for salt.
Warm the chicharrones for a few seconds in the microwave. In a shallow bowl, ladle in some bean broth, rice, beans (without broth), chicharrones, pico de gallo and hot sauce. Garnish with tortilla chips and avocado slices.’"

Output: "Ingredients:
- 2¾ teaspoons salt, divided
- ¼ teaspoon ground black pepper
- 2 teaspoons ground cumin, divided
- 3 pounds bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs and/or drumsticks
- 2 tablespoons vegetable oil
- 1 medium yellow onion, finely chopped
- 1 medium green bell pepper, finely chopped
- 2 cups long grain white rice (basmati works very well), rinsed
- 6 cloves garlic, minced
- ¼ cup tomato paste
- Approximately 3½ cups chicken broth (see note about measurement)
- ½ teaspoon dried oregano
- ¼ tsp ground turmeric (may substitute with annatto powder or bijol)
- ½ teaspoon sugar
- ¾ cup drained and halved pimento-stuffed green olives (from a 6-oz jar)
- 2 bay leaves
- 1 cup frozen peas, thawed
- ¼ cup chopped fresh cilantro (optional)
- Lemon or lime wedges, as garnish (optional)
Preparation:
Preheat the oven to 350°F and set an oven rack in the middle position.
In a small bowl, mix together 1½ teaspoons of the salt, the pepper, and 1 teaspoon of the cumin. Cut off any excessive fat on the chicken (leaving the skin intact). Blot the chicken with a paper towel and season both sides with the spice mixture.
Heat the oil in a large (5 to 6-qt) Dutch oven or heavy-bottomed, high-sided, oven-safe skillet over medium-high heat. Working in two batches so as not to crowd the pan, brown the chicken. For thighs, place the chicken skin side down, and sear until golden and crisp, 5 to 7 minutes. Flip and brown on the other side, 1 to 2 minutes more. For drumsticks, sear for 2 to 3 minutes on each side, turning to brown evenly all over. Using tongs, transfer the chicken to a large plate and set aside. If there is a lot of oil left in the pan, pour off all but about 2 tablespoons of the fat.
Return the pot to the stove and reduce the heat to medium-low. Add the onion and bell pepper and cook, stirring occasionally, until softened, 6 to 8 minutes. As you stir, scrape up any brown bits from the bottom of the pan and mix it into the vegetables. Add the rice, garlic, tomato paste, and remaining 1 teaspoon of cumin; cook, stirring constantly, until fragrant, another 2 to 3 minutes.
Add the chicken broth, oregano, turmeric, sugar, olives, bay leaves, and remaining 1¼ teaspoons salt. Nestle the chicken on top of this mixture and pour any remaining chicken drippings into the pan as well. Bring to a boil, then cover the pot with a lid and immediately transfer to the oven to bake for 35 minutes, or until the chicken registers 175°F on a meat thermometer.

AD
Remove the pan from the oven and let sit, covered, on a wire rack or the stovetop for 10 minutes.
Uncover the pan (remember the lid is hot!) and use tongs to transfer the chicken to a plate. Remove the bay leaves, and fluff the rice. Taste the rice to be sure it is fully cooked. (If it still tastes too firm, pour ½ cup water evenly over the rice, and give the rice a quick fluff again. Place the pan on the stovetop over low heat and cook, covered, for an additional 5 to 10 minutes. Uncover and taste to ensure the rice is cooked. Add more water and repeat if necessary.) Mix the peas and cilantro (if using) into the rice. Return the chicken pieces to the top of the rice. Alternatively, remove the skin, pull the meat off of the bones and shred into bite-sized chunks, and mix in with the rice. Serve or cover the pan to keep warm for up to 30 minutes until ready to serve. Serve with lemon or lime wedges.
Note: Check the instructions on your bag of rice for the proper ratio of rice to chicken broth. My extra long-grain basmati calls for 1¾ cups liquid for every 1 cup of rice, but every brand and type of rice is different."

Output: "Ingredients:
- 2 cups chicken breast, shredded (about 1 large or 2 small chicken breasts)
- 2 cups white rice
- 4 cups chicken broth
- Extra virgin olive oil
- 1 medium onion, chopped
- 1/2 red pepper, chopped
- 2 carrots, chopped
- 1 celery stalk, chopped
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 tablespoon Achiote paste (see notes above)
- 1 tablespoon Salsa Lizano
- 2 tablespoons fresh cilantro – If you don’t have this or don’t like the taste of cilantro, you can skip it.
Preparation:
First, you will want to prepare your chicken. Normally chicken breasts are used for this recipe, but dark meat is delicious too if you prefer that.
An easy way to get flavorful, browned meat is to pan fry it. You will want the chicken breasts to be somewhat thin (no more than about an inch thick), so you may need to cut them or pound them out. Get the skillet nice and hot on medium high heat and add about 1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil. Cook the chicken on each side, seasoning well with salt and pepper. Only flip it once and make sure to wait until the chicken releases itself from the pan. Don’t force it – if it’s sticking, that means it’s not ready yet. Once the outside starts to brown nicely, it should be fairly easy to flip. Don’t overcook it. Usually a few minutes on each side is all you need.
Remove the chicken from the pan and allow it to rest for a few minutes. It will continue to cook some. Once it cools, shred it into bite-size pieces. Set aside until the last step."

- 1 medium red bell pepper, seeded and cut into quarters
- 3 ají dulce or amarillo peppers (or mini bell peppers), seeded and coarsely chopped
- 6 large garlic cloves
- 1 large yellow onion, coarsely chopped
- 6 fresh culantro leaves and tender stems, coarsely chopped (see Note)
- 6 fresh cilantro stems, coarsely chopped
Preparation:
Prepare the adobo by whisking the ingredients together in a bowl, or blending in a small food processor, pilón or mortar and pestle.
Pat the chicken dry, then place in a large bowl or zip-top bag. Pour prepared adobo over chicken. Toss well to combine, then cover the bowl with a lid or plastic wrap, or seal the bag, and let the chicken rest in the fridge for at least 30 minutes. If you have the time, marinate for several hours or overnight to make the chicken extra tender and flavorful.
Prepare the sofrito: In a large food processor or blender, blend the peppers and garlic until smooth. Add the onion and blend until smooth, then add the culantro and cilantro and blend until smooth. (The preparation may produce more sofrito than needed for this recipe, but you can store additional sofrito in the fridge for up to 1 week, or in the freezer for up to 3 months.)
Add the rice to a medium bowl, then rinse with several rounds of cool water, pouring through a fine-mesh strainer until water runs out clear.
Once chicken is marinated, heat olive oil in a large heavy pot or Dutch oven over medium-high. When the oil is simmering, working in batches if necessary, add chicken in one layer and brown for 7 to 10 minutes per batch, turning several times to evenly brown.
Meanwhile, bring chicken broth (or water) to a boil in a medium saucepan. Reduce to a simmer until ready to use.
Add sofrito, bay leaves and annatto or paprika to pot with chicken and stir well. Reduce heat to medium, and sauté until liquid is mostly evaporated and sofrito thickens to a paste, about 7 to 10 minutes.
Add tomato sauce and cook for 3 to 5 minutes longer, until the sauce darkens. Add the rinsed rice, olives and capers (if using), and salt and pepper, and fold in to ensure that the rice is fully coated and the chicken is evenly distributed.
Pour in hot stock, then simmer, uncovered, over medium heat for about 15 minutes, stirring only 2 to 3 times and shaking the pot every few minutes to keep rice level. (The liquid surrounding the rice will lower by about 1 inch.) Watch the rice very closely: The window between just right and overcooked is small, and difficult to predict, but you’ll become an expert at this over time.
Once you start to spot lots of little bubbles on the surface but see no more pronounced liquid on top, top with the lid, reduce heat to low and cook until the rice is al dente, about 15 to 20 minutes, shaking pot a few times. Once liquid is almost entirely evaporated, sprinkle thawed peas on top.
Working directly in the pot, using 2 forks, pull apart chicken thighs until shredded. Gently fluff the rice, bringing grains from the bottom to the top. Return the lid and let rest for 10 to 15 minutes before serving.
Garnish with lime wedges, and serve with salted avocado and tomato slices (or a simple green salad). The dish keeps well in the refrigerator for 3 to 5 days."

First, pat the chicken thighs dry with a paper towel then season with salt, pepper, and cumin.
In a wide Dutch oven or large pot with a heavy bottom and a lid, heat 2 tablespoons of olive oil. Over medium heat, place chicken thighs in the pan and brown on both sides. Transfer to a plate.
Next, add the remaining olive oil and sauté onion, garlic and red pepper, stirring frequently, until the onion is translucent and the garlic is fragrant.
Add the rice, chicken stock, tomato sauce, annatto powder, bay leaf, oregano, cumin, salt, and pepper to the saucepan. Stir to combine all the ingredients.
Bring to a boil then add the chicken thighs to the mixture. Reduce heat to low and cover with the lid.
Cooking low and slow will ensure you don't burn the rice. Every stove cooks differently so after 40 minutes, take a peek and see if the liquid has been absorbed. If yes, remove the pot from the heat immediately so it doesn't continue to cook with the residual heat. If not, continue to cook in 5 minute increments until all the liquid has been absorbed and the rice is tender. Remove pot from the heat.

Sauté the mixture until it's fragrant and most of the liquid has cooked out. A spoon run down the middle of the pan should leave a dry trail.
Add the rice, sazón, and salt and gently mix them into all of the ingredients, so that every grain is covered in the sauce. Add chicken stock and bring to a boil. Allow mixture to boil undisturbed until some of the stock has evaporated and the rice is visible on the surface of the pot, about 5 to 8 minutes. There should be multiple round steam vents on the surface of the rice.
Place the reserved chicken thighs on top of the rice. Lower the heat to low and cover the pot with a tight-fitting heavy lid. Cook for 20 minutes, until all of the stock has evaporated and rice has cooked through.
Remove the chicken from the pot and set it aside. Stir in frozen peas and fluff the rice. Add the chicken thighs back to the pot. Garnish with the remainder of the diced red pepper and cilantro leaves."

- 2 cups uncooked rice

- 3 plum tomatoes
- 1/2 small onion
- 2 garlic cloves
- 1 jalapeno
- 1 tablespoon Mexican oregano
- 1/4 teaspoon cumin (optional)
- 0-1 teaspoons salt (to taste)
- freshly cracked black pepper
- freshly chopped cilantro (optional)
- olive oil
Preparation:
I usually brine the chicken, but keep in mind this step is optional if you want a faster version. Add 2 quarts of cold water to a large mixing bowl along with 1/2 cup Kosher salt. Mix well to dissolve the salt and then add the chicken thighs. Cover and let brine in the fridge for 30-60 minutes.
Rinse and de-stem 3 plum tomatoes. Roast the tomatoes in the oven (400F) for 30 minutes or until you need them.
Remove the chicken pieces from the brine and pat dry. Pre-heat a deep skillet or saucepan over medium-high heat and add a big glug of oil, 2-3 tablespoons worth. Once the oil is hot you can add the chicken, browning both sides for a few minutes each. I usually start with the skin side down, cook until the skin is browning, then flip and cook the underside for another few minutes. Once browned, you can remove the chicken from the pan and set aside. Note: if you brine your chicken the skin may not crisp up as readily as it has absorbed some of the saltwater.
Add 2 cups uncooked rice to the pan that you used to brown the chicken (the chicken has been set aside for now). Cook the rice for a few minutes over medium heat, stirring regularly.
As the rice is cooking, add the following ingredients to a blender: the roasted tomatoes, 1/2 small onion, 2 garlic cloves, and 1 jalapeno. Combine well. For a milder version you can use less jalapeno.
When the rice is turning opaque and light brown in color you can add the blended tomato-jalapeno mixture. Cook for a couple minutes, stirring regularly. Then add the remaining ingredients: 3 cups stock, 1 tablespoon Mexican oregano, 1/4 teaspoon cumin (optional), freshly cracked black pepper, and salt (optional). Bring it up to a boil and do some taste testing. The exact level of salt to be added will depend on which stock you use. If using store-bought stock you may not need to add much salt at all. If using water you'll probably need to add a heaping teaspoon of salt. Taste test and add pinches of salt until this mixture tastes good to you.
Add the browned chicken to the pan. Bring it up to a boil, then reduce heat to low, cover, and let simmer for 20-25 minutes.
Once all the liquid is absorbed by the rice (usually somewhere around the 20 minute mark) you can remove it from the heat and let it sit in its own steam for a few minutes, covered.
Serve up your chicken pieces over a bed of rice and optionally top with freshly chopped cilantro.
Store leftovers in the fridge where they will keep for a few days. The rice is dee-licious, feel free to use it over the coming days in burritos, tacos, tostadas, or even just mixed with some black beans. Enjoy!"
